## Aims

This assignment aims to give you practice in

* reading and understanding a moderately large relational schema (MyMyUNSW)
* implementing SQL queries and views to satisfy requests for information
* implementing SQL/PLpgSQL functions to aid in satisfying requests for information

The goal is to build some useful data access operations on the MyMyUNSW database, which contains a wealth of information about what happens at UNSW. One aim of this assignment is to use SQL queries (packaged as views) to extract such information. Another is to build SQL/PlpgSQL functions that can support higher-level activities, such as might be needed in a Web interface.

A theme of this assignment is "dirty data". As I was building the database, using a collection of reports from UNSW's information systems and the database for the academic proposal system (MAPPS), I discovered that there were some inconsistencies in parts of the data (e.g. duplicate entries in the table for UNSW buildings, or students who were mentioned in the student data, but had no enrolment records, and, worse, enrolment records with marks and grades for students who did not exist in the student data). I removed most of these problems as I discovered them, but no doubt missed some. Some of the exercises below aim to uncover such anomalies; please explore the database and let me know if you find other anomalies.

## Introduction

All Universities require a significant information infrastructure in order to manage their affairs. This typically involves a large commercial DBMS installation. UNSW's student information system sits behind the MyUNSW web site. MyUNSW provides an interface to a PeopleSoft enterprise management system with an underlying Oracle database. This back-end system (Peoplesoft/Oracle) is sometimes called NSS. The specific version of PeopleSoft that we use is called Campus Solutions.

Despite its successes, however, MyUNSW/NSS still has a number of deficiencies, including:

* no easy way to swap classes once enrolled
* no representation for degree program structures
* poor integration with the UNSW Online Handbook

The first point is inconvenient, since it means that the only way for a student to change tute classes is to drop the course and re-enrol into the course, selecting th new tute. If the course is already full, students would be unwilling to drop the course in case someone else grabs their place before they can re-enrol.
The second point prevents MyUNSW/NSS from being used for three important operations that would be extremely helpful to students in managing their enrolment:

* finding out how far they have progressed through their degree program, and what remains to be completed
* checking what are their enrolment options for next semester (e.g. get a list of suggested courses)
* determining when they have completed all of the requirements of their degree program and are eligible to graduate

In this assignment, you will be working with two instances of a database to hold information about academic matters at UNSW. The first database instance (mymy1) contains data from 2000 to 2015. The second database instance (mymy2) will contain data from 2014 to 2019. Note that all People data about students, and much of the People data about staff is synthetic.

## Questions
1. Define an SQL view Q1(unswid,name) that gives the student id and name of any student who has enrolled in more than 4 distinct programs at UNSW. The name should be take from the People.name field for the student, and the student id should be taken from People.unswid.

2. Define an SQL view Q2(unswid,name,course_cnt) that gives the unswid and name of the person(s) who has been course tutor of the most courses at UNSW and the number of courses they have been course tutor for. In the database, the course tutor has the role of Course Tutor.

3. Define an SQL view Q3(unswid,name) that gives all the distinct international students who have enrolled in the course offered by the School of Law (refers to the OrgUnits.Name) and got a mark higher than 85.

4. Define a SQL view Q4(unswid,name) that gives all the distinct local students who enrolled in COMP9020 and COMP9331 (refer to Subjects.code) in the same term.

5. For the mymy1 database instance ... Define an SQL view Q5a(term,min_fail_rate) that gives the term and the minimum fail rate of the course COMP3311 from year 2009 to year 2012.

    For the mymy2 database instance ... Define an SQL view Q5b(term,min_fail_rate) that gives the term and the minimum fail rate of the course COMP3311 from year 2016 to year 2019.

    Note:
    The term should be taken from Terms.name;
    Only count the students with valid marks (not null), fail rate = (number of students with mark less than 50 / number of students with mark);
    Round min_fail_rate to the nearest 0.0001. (i.e. if minimum fail rate = 0.01, then return 0.0100; if minimum fail rate = 0.01234, then return 0.0123; if minimum fail rate = 0.02345, then return 0.0235). This rounding behaviour is different from the IEEE 754 specification for floating point rounding which PostgreSQL uses for float/real/double precision types. PostgreSQL only performs this type of rounding for numeric and decimal types.

6. Define an SQL function (SQL, not PLpgSQL) called Q6(id integer, code text) that takes as parameters: a People.id value (i.e. an internal database identifier) and a Subjects.code value (i.e. a subject code), and returns the student's mark for the course with the given subject code. If either id or code is invalid, return NULL as the result.

    The function must use the following interface:
    ```
    create or replace function Q6(id integer, code text) returns integer
    ```

7. Define an SQL function (SQL, not PLpgSQL) called Q7(year integer, session text) that takes as parameters the year (e.g. 2019) and a session (aka term e.g. 'T1'), and returns a list of all the postgraduate COMP courses (refers to Subjects.code starting with COMP) offered at the given year and session. An postgraduate course is the one whose Subjects.career is PG.

    The function must use the following interface:
    ```
    create or replace function Q7(year integer, session text)
        returns table (code text)
    ```

8. Define a PLpgSQL function Q8(zid integer), which takes a student zid (People.unswid) and produces a term transcript as a table of TermTranscriptRecords. Each transcript record should contain information about the student's attempt of a term. Records should appear ordered chronologically by term.

    Use the following definition for the transcript tuples:
    ```
    create type TermTranscriptRecord as (
        term  		char(4), -- term code (e.g. 98s1)
        termwam  	integer, -- numeric term WAM acheived
        termuocpassed   integer  -- units of credit passed this term
    );
    ```

    Note that this type is already defined in the database. term in a record can be obtained by termName(terms.id). But it is text type. Use CAST (termName(terms.id) AS char(4)) to convert it into char(4) type.

    Only count a UOC value when calculating termuocpassed if the student actually passed the course (i.e. has a grade from the set {SY, PT, PC, PS, CR, DN, HD, A, B, C}) or has an XE grade (for credit from exchange) or a T grade (transferred credit) or a PE grade (professional experience) or a RC or RS grade (research courses)). A null grade or any grade other than those just mentioned should not be treated as a pass. (For simplicity, grade GP and EC are treated as unpassed)

    Only results with associated marks are included in the termwam calculation. If no mark or grade is available for a course (a null mark or grade), do not consider it when calcualting termwam. (i.e. grade SY, PT, XE, T, PE, RC and RS...or other grade-only results, they normally have a null mark).

    termuocpassed and termwam are computed as follows:
    ```
    termuocpassed = Œ£UOC for all courses passed in this term
    termwam = Œ£(M*U)/Œ£U for all courses completed (marked) in this term
    M = mark received in a course
    U = units of credit for a course
    ```

    Round the WAM value to the nearest integer and refer to the note of Q5. (i.e. the nearest integer of 10.49 is 10; the nearest integer of 10.50 is 11) If no termwam or termwam is 0 this term, set termwam as null; If no courses have been passed this term, set termuocpassed as null. Examples can be found in Example page.

    At the end of the transcript, add an extra TermTranscriptRecord which contains
    ```
    ('OVAL', overallwam, overalluocpassed)
    ```
    where the overalluocpassed and overallwam are computed as follows:
    ```
    overalluocpassed = Œ£UOC for all courses passed
    overallwam = Œ£(M*U)/Œ£U for all courses completed (marked)
    M = mark received in a course
    U = units of credit for a course
    ```

    The calculation rules are similar between the term and overall. Round the WAM value to the nearest integer. If no overallwam or overallwam is 0, just set overallwam as null; If no courses have been passed overall, set overalluocpassed as null.

    For simplicity, ignore the situiation of degree changes. If a student zid is invalid, return an empty table. See the example in Example page.

    How can you find interesting transcripts to look at? The answer is to think of some properties of a transcript that might make it interesting, and then ask a query to get information about any students who have these kinds of transcripts. I used the following query to find some students. Work out what it does and then try variations to find other kinds of "interesting" students:

    ```
    select p.unswid,pr.code,termName(min(pe.term)),count(*)
    from   People p
            join Program_enrolments pe on (pe.student=p.id)
            join Programs pr on (pe.program=pr.id)
    where  pr.code like '3%'
    group  by p.unswid,pr.code
    having count(*) > 5;
    ```

9. An important part of defining academic rules in MyMyUNSW is the ability to define groups of academic objects (e.g. groups of subjects, streams or programs) In MyMyUNSW, groups can be defined in three different ways:

    * enumerated by giving a list of objects in a X_members table
    * pattern by giving a pattern that identifies all relevant objects
    * query by storing an SQL query which returns a set of object ids
    
    In all cases, the result is a set of academic objects of a specific type (given in the gtype attribute).

    Write a PLpgSQL function Q9(gid integer) that takes the internal ID of an academic object group and returns the codes for all members of the academic object group, including any child groups. Associated with each code should be the type of the corresponding object, either subject, stream or program.

    You should return distinct codes (i.e. ignore multiple versions of any object), and there is no need to check whether the academic object is still being offered.

    The function is defined as follows:
    ```
    create or replace function Q9(gid integer) returns setof AcObjRecord
    ```
    where AcObjRecord is already defined in the database as follows:
    ```
    create type AcObjRecord as (
        objtype text,  -- academic object's type e.g. subject, stream, program
        objcode text   -- academic object's code e.g. COMP3311, SENGA1, 3978
    );
    ```
    Groups of academic objects are defined in the tables:
    * acad_object_groups(id, name, gtype, glogic, gdefby, negated, parent, definition)
    * program_group_members(program, ao_group) ... for enumerated program groups
    * stream_group_members(stream, ao_group) ... for enumerated stream groups
    * subject_group_members(subject, ao_group) ... for enumerated subject groups

    There are a wide variety of patterns. You should explore the acad_object_groups table yourself to see what's available. To give you a head start, here are some existing patterns and what they mean:

    * COMP2### ... any level 2 computing course (e.g. COMP2911, COMP2041)
    * COMP[34]### ... any level 3 or 4 computing course (e.g. COMP3311, COMP4181)
    * ####1### ... any level 1 course at UNSW
    * (COMP|SENG|BINF)2### ... any level 2 course from CSE
    * COMP1917,COMP1927 ... core first year computing courses
    * COMP1###,COMP2### ... same as COMP[12]###

    You do not need to handle any of the following types of academic object groups:
    * any groups defined using a query (gdefby='query')
    * any groups defined using negation (negated=true)
    * any groups defined by a pattern which includes 'FREE', 'GEN' or 'F=' as a substring

    For any group like the above, simply return no reults (zero rows). You can also ignore the glogic field; treat them all as or groups.

    If any group has a child group containing FREE, ignore just the child group. For pattern groups, you do not need to check whether codes used in the pattern correspond to real objects in the relevant table (e.g. a pattern string may contain a subject code which does not exist in the Subjects table)

    Your function should be able to expand any pattern element from the above classes of patterns (i.e. pattern elements that include #, [...] and (...|...)). If patterns include {xxx;yyy;zzz} alternatives, include all of the alternatives as group members (i.e. as if they were xxx,yyy,zzz). If patterns have child patterns, include all of the acdemic objects in the child patterns. You can recognise that a group with id=X has child groups, by the existnce of other academic groups with parent=X.

    Hint: In order to solve this, you'll probably need to look in the PostgreSQL manual at Section 9.4 "String Functions and Operators" and Section 42.5.4 "Executing Dynamic Commands".

    10. Define a PLpgSQL function that takes a subject code and returns the set of all subjects that include this subject in their pre-reqs. This kind of function could help in planning what courses you could study in subsequent semesters.

    The function is defined as follows:
    ```
    create or replace function Q10(code text) returns setof text ...
    ```

    You only need to consider literal subject codes (e.g. COMP1234) in the pre-reqs. If a pre-req object group contains a pattern, ignore the pattern.

    Hint: This function can probably make use of (a variation of) the Q9() function.
