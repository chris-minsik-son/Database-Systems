## Aims

This assignment aims to give you practice in

* manipulating a moderately large database (IMDB)
* implementing SQL views to satisfy requests for information
* implementing PLpgSQL functions to satisfy requests for information
* implementing Python scripts to extract and display data

The goal is to build some useful data access operations on the Internet Movie Database (IMDB), which contains a wealth of information about movies, actors, etc. You need to write Python scripts, using the Psycopg2 database connectivity module, to extract and display information from this database.

## Introduction

The Internet Movie Database (IMDB) is a huge collection of information about all kinds of video media. It has data about most movies since the dawn of cinema, but also a vast amount of information about TV series, documentaries, short films, etc. Similarly, it holds information about the people who worked on and starred in these video artefacts. It also hold viewer ratings and crticis reviews for video artefacts as well as a host of other trivia (e.g. bloopers).

The full IMDB database is way too large to let you all build copies of it, so we have have created a cut-down version of the database that deals with well-rated movies from the last 60 years. You can find more details on the database schema in the [Database Design] page.

Some comments about the data in our copy of IMDB: there seems to be preponderance of recent Bollywood movies; some of the aliases look incorrect (e.g. for "Shawshank Redemption"); the data only goes to mid 2019, so you won't find recent blockbusters.

## Questions
1. Complete the script called "q1.py" so that it prints a list of the top N people who have directed the most movies (default N = 10). The script takes a single command-line argument which specifies how many people should appear in the list. People should be ordered from largest to smallest by the number of movies he/she directed, and should be displayed as, e.g.

    ```
    vxdb$ python3 q1.py 5
    48 Woody Allen
    40 Takashi Miike
    39 Jean-Luc Godard
    37 Claude Chabrol
    36 Martin Scorsese
    ```

    Within groups of people with the same number of movies, people should be ordered alphabetically by his/her name (Names.name). If the user supplies a number less than 1, print the following message and exit.

    ```
    vxdb$ python3 q1.py 0
    Usage: q1.py [N]
    ```

    For more examples of how the script behaves, see [Sample Outputs].

2. Complete the script called "q2.py" so that it prints a list of the different releases (different regions, different languages) for a movie. The script takes a single command-line argument which gives a part of a movie name (could be the entire name or a pattern). If no argument is given, print the following message and exit.

    ```
    vxdb$ python3 q2.py
    Usage: q2.py 'PartialMovieTitle'
    ```

    If there are no movies matching the supplied partial-name, then you should print a message to this effect and quit the program, e.g.

    ```
    vxdb$ python3 q2.py xyzzy
    No movie matching 'xyzzy'
    ```

    If the partial-name matches multiple movies, simply print a list of matching movies (rating, title, year of release), ordered by rating (highest to lowest), then year of release (earliest to latest) and then by title (alphabetical order), e.g.

    ```
    vxdb$ python3 q2.py mothra
    Movies matching 'mothra'
    ===============
    7.1 Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack (2001)
    6.6 Mothra (1961)
    6.5 Mothra vs. Godzilla (1964)
    6.2 Godzilla and Mothra: The Battle for Earth (1992)
    ```

    If the partial name matches exactly one movie, then print that movie's title and year, and then print a list of all of the other releases (aliases) of the movie. If there are no aliases, print "Title (Year) has no alternative releases". For each alias, show at least the title. If a region exists, add this, and if a language is specified, add it as well, e.g.,

    ```
    vxdb$ python3 q2.py 2001
    2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) was also released as
    '2001' (region: XWW, language: en)
    'Two Thousand and One: A Space Odyssey' (region: US)
    '2001: Odisea del espacio' (region: UY)
    '2001: Een zwerftocht in de ruimte' (region: NL)
    ```

    Movie releases should be ordered accoring to the ordering attribute in the Aliases table.

    If an alias has no region or language, then put the string in the extra_info field in the parentheses. If it has neither region, language or extra info, just print the local title (without parentheses).

    Note that if there are two movies with exactly the same original title, you will not be able to view their releases, since the title alone does not distinguish them. We consider this problem in the next question. Such tests will not be covered in this question.

    For more examples of how the script behaves, see [Sample Outputs].

3. Complete the script called "q3.py" so that it prints a list of cast and crew for a movie. The script takes a command-line argument which gives a part of a movie name (could be the entire name or a pattern). It also takes an optional command-line argument, which is a year and can be used to distinguish movies with the same title (or, at least, titles which match the partial movie name).

    ```
    vxdb$ python3 q3.py
    Usage: q3.py 'MovieTitlePattern' [Year]
    ```

    If there are no movies matching the supplied partial-name, then you should print a message to this effect and quit the program, e.g.,

    ```
    vxdb$ python3 q3.py xyzzy
    No movie matching 'xyzzy'
    ```

    If the partial-name matches multiple movies, simply print a list of matching movies, the same as in Q2. If you need to disambiguate, either use a larger partial-name or add a year to the command line. If a longer partial-name and year still doesn't disambiguate, print a list of matching movies as above.

    If the command-line arguments identify a single movie, then print the movie details (title and year), followed by a list of the principal actors and their roles, followed by a list of the principal crew members and their roles. The list of actors should be sorted according to the ordering attribute in the Principals table (i.e the biggest star comes first) and then by the name of the role they played if the ordering attribute is equal (i.e. one actor plays multiple roles). The list of crew members should also be sorted according to the ordering attribute in the Principals table and then by role name, if the ordering attribute is the same (e.g. one person has multiple crew roles).

    Some movies are not in Principals table, they will not be tested. For more examples of how the script behaves, see [Sample Outputs].

4. Complete the script called "q4.py" so that it prints a filmography for a given person (Names), showing their roles in each of the movies they have been a principal in. The script takes a command-line argument which gives a part of a person's name (could be the entire name or a pattern). It also takes an optional command-line argument, which is a year (their birth year) and which can be used to distinguish people with similar names. If there are no arguments or there are invalid arguments, print the following message and exit.

    ```
    vxdb$ python3 q4.py
    Usage: q4.py 'NamePattern' [Year]
    ```

    If the name pattern, optionally combined with a year, doesn't match anyone in the Names table, then you should print a message to this effect and quit the program

    ```
    vxdb$ python3 q4.py Smmith
    No name matching 'Smmith'
    ```

    If the name pattern, optionally combined with a year, matches more than one person, then print a list of the matching people, with the years they were born and died in parentheses afer the name. If birth year is invalid, e.g., null, regardless of whether death year is valid or not, print (???); if birth year is valid but death year is invalid, print (bbbb-); if both are valid, print (bbbb-dddd). Below is an example.

    ```
    vxdb$: python3 q4.py rooney
    Names matching 'rooney'
    ===============
    Darrell Rooney (???)
    Frank Rooney (1913-)
    Jennie Rooney (???)
    Mickey Rooney (1920-2014)
    Nancy Rooney (???)
    Rooney Mara (1985-)
    Sharon Rooney (1988-)
    ```
    Order people by their names alphabetically, then by birth year in chronological order. If two people have the same name and birth year, put them in order of their Names.id value (ascending).

    If the name pattern, optionally combined with a year, matches a single person, then you should print their name and birth and death years (use the above rules), followed by two parts:

    The First Part: Two pieces of information, the first one gives their 'personal rating', that is the average rating of all movies they have been a principal in. Use AVG() function to calculate the average, convert the average to decimal, then use ROUND(avg,1) to one decimal place. If no movie is found, set the persoanl rating as 0; the second one gives top 3 movie genres of all movies they have been a principal in. The movie genres should be ordered by the number of such movies they have been a principal in, then the genre name (alphabetically). If there are less than 3 genres in total, just print all of them. If no genre, leave blank. (See examples)

    The Second Part: A list of all the movies (with start years) they have been a principal in. Movies should be in chronological order; if there are multiple movies in a given year, order them by title within the year. For each movie, show first any acting roles they had, including the role they played, and then any production crew roles they had. If a movie has him/her in its principal list but no acting roles or crew roles can be found, only print the movie title and its start year. If no movie is found, leave blank. (See examples)

    Note that one person could be both an actor and a director in the same movie. If a person has multiple roles as an actor in one movie, then show the records in order of the role name. Similarly for multiple roles as a crew member, order by role name.

    ```
    vxdb$ python3 q4.py 'spike lee'
    Filmography for Spike Lee (1957-)
    ===============
    Personal Rating: 7.1
    Top 3 Genres:
    drama
    comedy
    documentary
